### To build & run using terminal
Open a powershell terminal, go to "build" directory and run `\build_and_run.ps1`. This will build the `SimplePublisher` and `SimpleSubscriber` projects and start both of them and run for 10 seconds.

### To build & run using Visual studio

Set both projects (`SimplePublisher` and `SimpleSubscriber`) as startup projects and F5.
